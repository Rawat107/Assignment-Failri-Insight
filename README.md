## Entry-Level Programmer Intern Assignments

As an AI assistant, I'm happy to provide a set of assignments for entry-level programmer interns. These assignments are designed to assess the candidates' fundamental programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and their potential to contribute to your software development team.

### Assignment 1: Coding Challenge

- Implement a simple command-line application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
- The application should prompt the user to enter two numbers and the desired operation, then display the result.
- Ensure the application handles invalid inputs and provides appropriate error messages.
- Bonus: Implement additional features, such as support for more complex operations or the ability to save and load previous calculations.

### Assignment 2: Data Structures and Algorithms

- Write a program that implements a singly linked list data structure.
- The program should allow users to perform basic operations on the linked list, such as inserting, deleting, and searching for elements.
- Implement a function to reverse the order of the elements in the linked list.
- Bonus: Implement additional linked list operations, such as finding the middle element or merging two sorted linked lists.

### Assignment 3: Web Development

- Create a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The application should have a user interface that allows users to input and submit a form.
- Upon form submission, the application should display the submitted data in a visually appealing way.
- Bonus: Implement server-side functionality using a backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Python, or PHP) to handle form submissions and store the data.

### Assignment 4: Database Management

- Design a simple database schema for a customer management system.
- Implement the schema using a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
- Write SQL queries to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
- Bonus: Implement additional features, such as data validation, indexing, or query optimization.

### Assignment 5: Software Design and Architecture

- Analyze a given software system and identify its key components, dependencies, and architectural patterns.
- Propose improvements or modifications to the system's design to address any identified issues or enhance its functionality.
- Provide a detailed report outlining your analysis and recommendations, including diagrams or models to illustrate your ideas.
- Bonus: Implement a prototype or proof-of-concept to demonstrate your proposed design changes.
